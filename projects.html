      <h1>A shocking Revelation</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The literacy rates are steadily growing in the rural areas of Nigeria.
        Yet, the majority of the students are studying <br />in less than
        favorable conditions. Many children study in roofless classrooms that
        have bare minimum school <br />supplies. The scarcity of school supplies
        or classroom supplies in the rural areas of Nigeria is common. Even the
        ones inside a <br />
        classroom study under shabby conditions. They are stuffed like chickens
        inside a coop with no space to move. <br />
        The worst part is that most of them are found sitting on the floor as
        the notion of desks and chairs is still <br />deemed a luxury in the
        small schools that cater to these young minds.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        At Angels Foundation, we work round the clock to provide adequate school
        and classroom supplies to <br />
        children studying in unfavorable conditions in Nigeria. You can play
        your part making their lives better <br />by donating to this cause.
        Connect with us for more information.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>Can you imagine learning in these conditions?</p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Probably not! The mere setup of a classroom is based on neat rows of
        desks and workstations for the children. <br />
        So that they can read, write and learn without any hindrance. But this
        remains to be a dream for thousands of <br />
        pupils trying to seek education in most rural areas of Nigeria.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Come switch on the beacon of light in these dusty spaces and dim lit
        classrooms!

          <hr />
          <p>
            Angels Foundation hopes to transform this scene. 
            We want to see a classroom  <br>filled with laughter, books 
            and desks making our child literacy project a  <br> reality. So 
            that these bright, eager children get the best education 
            possible that <br> too in conditions that meet normal 
            standards of an educational institute.

          <h4>Our Plan</h4>
          <hr />

          <p>
            Desk for Children is a collaborative effort between <br />
            Angels Foundation and other NGOs. We aim to <br />
            collect sufficient funds via fundraisers, online charity <br />
            campaigns and sheer goodwill. The money will then be <br />
            used in school maintenance funds. The primary focus <br />
            will obviously be on the desks which ultimately pave <br />
            a clear route for our child literacy programs. <br>

        <h6>Off the Street Program: <b>Street to Strength</b></h6>

        <hr>
        <p>To help vulnerable or street-involved children <br> transition into safe environments, access education <br> and healthcare, and build life skills for a sustainable <br> future. We hope to achieve our goal here by <br> doing the following:</p>
         
        <ul>
          <li>Enroll children in formal schools or <br> bridge learning programs to catch up.</li>
          <li>Establishing safe shelters and rehabilitation <br> centers for ex-cultists.</li>
          <li>Offer vocational training for older children <br> (e.g., tailoring, mechanics, coding, crafts).</li>
          <li>Offer healthcare services, including <br> mental health support.</li>
          <li>Create community awareness and advocacy programs.</li>
          <li>Build partnerships with local organizations <br> and government bodies.</li>
